I took this problem from Leetcode and I tried to solve it. I partially did that (I will explain why only partially later)
This problem was one of the hardest problems there (rate of acceptance 13%), so it was a challenge for me. Many of you maybe face-palmed many times when you reed what I built
I didn't tried to make it perfect or usable in a real environment. Just to make it work. To give you a picture, I tried to make a rocket not to go to the Mars, 
but to understand more about rocket science. Here is the same story, I tried to learn and understand more about programming. I have little to 0 experience in C++, but I did my best
Any constructive cricism is wellcome as soon is civilized :)

The program work partially because it gives more steps than it should. Let say you pass AA to program it will output 7 instead of 4. But other than this, I didn't found any errors  

Thanks
